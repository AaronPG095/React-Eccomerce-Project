### NOTES
* installed SASS (as you can see I made a styles folder with a main.scss file)
* installed styled-components if we want to use that(maybe a vit of both would be good)
* Feel free to rename/move folders around if you think we could structure it better
* custom hook for fetching APIS (DataFetcher.jsx in the functions folder)
